# The World Wide Web

## How the Web Works

At it's core, the internet is just a bunch of computers connected together. 

Now obviously we can't physically connect all of our computers together with one mega cable, so we rely on an internet connection to keep all of our computers connected. Companies like AT&T, Spectrum, Starlink, etc. all exist to maintain the infrastructure (i.e. miles and miles of underground cables) so we don't have to.

🔑 Key Point 🔑

The ONLY WAY that the internet works is if all of these connected computers speak the same language. And sure enough, they all do!

    For those that are interested, it's called Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http). Additionally, Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across between computers. You may promptly forget this infromation 😶‍🌫️

### Clients and Servers

Some devices, like the one you're reading this on, are referred to as a "client." These are typically used by people using an app or a web browser.

Other devices are referred to as "servers." Servers are computers dedicated to storing data or processing information, and are (sometimes) in super secure, climate controlled underground bunkers that can withstand power outages or even a nuclear strike from Russia ☠️. They don't usually need a human interface. You've probably seen pictures of servers like this:

TO CONSIDER: If this is too short, we could do a mini JS portion -- have them add some that fetches a dad joke -- would be good for prepping for cybersecurity ddos topic.
