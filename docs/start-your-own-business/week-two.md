# Week 2 - Experiment! Validating Your Business Idea

## Pre-Project Preparation



1. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEMbKzy7FD8&t=187s) about creating a business plan
2. Choose one of the following inspiring entrepreneur biographies and pick it up from the library (or purchase it if you want to keep it!). We'll read these biographies over the coming weeks, but once you get it then go ahead and get started by reading the first chapter!

  

Here's the list (choose  **one**):

-  [Creativity, Inc](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Expanded-Overcoming-Inspiration/dp/B0BPF121ZJ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2WJTTBR29M9LE&keywords=creative%2C+inc&qid=1695908081&s=audible&sprefix=creative%2C+inc%2Caudible%2C92&sr=1-4)  (about the founder of Pixar)

-  [Sweet Success](https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Success-Simple-Recipe-Passion/dp/B0B64G46Q9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3C2QD4U837WN6&keywords=sweet+success+book&qid=1695908063&s=audible&sprefix=sweet+succ%2Caudible%2C97&sr=1-1)  (about the founder of one of the most successful bakeries in the USA)

-  [Shoe Dog](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Phil-Knight-audiobook/dp/B01CRJA470/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38JGMGG8Y48D9&keywords=shoe+dog&qid=1695908045&sprefix=shoe+dog%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-1)  (about the founder of Nike)





## Project

Begin working on the following project!



[Fill out the 'Validate Your Idea' form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCNiIF51_LlWLaNiQgaNoCZEm3lBf-0zkOD3Xrm3yJg/edit?usp=sharing) (and be sure to talk to real potential customers!)

Here's what you'll do: 
1.  Describe your business idea: What will the business do? What problem does it solve or what experience does it provide? Add enough detail so that someone without ANY idea what you’re talking about can understand
    
2.  Identify key assumptions that if wrong would result in a large amount of wasted time & effort
    
3.  Think of a way to create an early version of your business or product that you can use to test on people
    
4.  Test your idea on 3-5 potential customers
    
5.  Determine if you should “pivot or persevere”
